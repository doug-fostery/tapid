# Client release distribution

Status: the GitHub and crates.io flow has historical verification through `v0.0.8`. The release-record changes below target the next release, expected `v0.0.11`; they are not evidence of a published release or deployed website routes.

## Scope and sources of truth

This document is the operator runbook for releasing the Tapid command-line client. The implementation sources of truth are:

- `.github/workflows/release-publication.yml` for binary builds and draft GitHub releases;
- `.github/workflows/release-public-smoke.yml` for public installer verification;
- `.github/workflows/crates-publication.yml` for separate crates.io publication;
- `tools/release/release.ts` for tag validation, checksums, and release-record generation;
- `tools/release/publish.ts` for the dependency-ordered crates.io plan;
- `docs/releases/<version>.md` for reviewed release notes.

ADR 0004 records why Tapid uses this GitHub-native design. This runbook records how to operate and recover it.
The [`v0.0.8` operations record](releases/0.0.8-operations.md) preserves the first complete release's concrete evidence and failure lessons.

## Trust model

Tapid relies on the reviewed repository, an annotated version tag, GitHub Actions, the owned domain and its route configuration, the release provider, HTTPS, and repository release immutability. New release archives are accompanied by `SHA256SUMS` and the [release record](release-record-v1.md). GitHub remains the initial provider.

The checksum detects corruption, truncation, and accidental asset substitution. Because the checksum and archive come from the same GitHub release, it is not an independent authenticity proof. Tapid does not currently claim a separate signed release trust root.

The new installers accept only stable `vX.Y.Z` versions and HTTPS release endpoints. They consume the record through `tapid.dev/releases/v1/latest.tsv`, or the corresponding `vVERSION.tsv` route for an explicit new version. They validate metadata and archive size, verify SHA-256, require exactly one expected regular executable in the archive, extract into a temporary directory, and stage the destination before replacement. Explicit versions through 0.0.10 retain the historical GitHub archive and `SHA256SUMS` path unless `TAPID_RELEASE_RECORD_URL` is supplied.

Released Tapid 0.0.10 first attempts signed discovery, then uses the canonical GitHub Releases API and `SHA256SUMS` when both default endpoints are unavailable. The next-release default upgrade path reads the same owned-domain release record as the installers, with no GitHub discovery fallback. `--release-url` or `TAPID_RELEASE_RECORD_URL` overrides the record URL; explicit `--endpoint` retains the legacy signed protocol. Invalid received metadata and mismatched downloads fail. Metadata unavailability may use last-known-good recovery but reports that the latest release could not be checked. Identical verified executable bytes leave the installation unchanged. Use `tapid upgrade --dry-run` to inspect the selected release without replacing the binary.

## First release-record rollout

This is a one-time cutover, expected for 0.0.11. Subsequent releases generate the record in the ordinary draft workflow and need no website edit.

1. Review the client, installers, publisher, website routes, and tests together. Prepare the website change, but do not deploy the new default installer copies while the latest public release lacks `tapid-release-v1.tsv`.
2. Build and review the first eight-asset draft. Verify the record against all six downloaded archives, including version, immutable URLs, sizes, and hashes. Keep existing public installation working during draft review.
3. Publish the reviewed draft after approval. Deploy the prepared website routes and installer copies at the controlled cutover, then verify the latest and explicit-version public record routes and public installation. The route returns 404 before a record-bearing release is public, so source tests alone cannot prove this step.
4. Require the public smoke evidence described below. If the automatic publication run raced the website cutover, rerun the original release-event workflow run after the routes and installer copies are deployed, and retain both attempts. A new manual dispatch does not satisfy the crates.io gate, which requires a successful `release` event run with the exact release title and tag commit.
5. Verify an installed 0.0.10 upgrades through its existing GitHub fallback to the new binary, then repeats through the new record path with an already-up-to-date result. Keep historical `/stable.json` behavior unchanged; placing unsigned metadata there breaks released signed-discovery clients.

The website routes are static provider mappings: `latest.tsv` redirects to GitHub's latest release asset, and `vVERSION.tsv` redirects to that version's asset. Provider migration changes those mappings and the published artifact URLs. It does not require per-release website deployment or signing-key operations.

## Versioning policy

The Git tag, GitHub release, `tapid` Cargo package, and `tapid --version` output share one product version.

Supporting crates are versioned independently. Publish a supporting crate only when its packaged contents or dependency requirements changed. Do not republish unrelated or unchanged workspace crates merely to align their numbers with the product release.

When an internal `0.0.x` crate changes, update its version and every affected dependent requirement deliberately. Cargo treats `0.0.x` requirements narrowly, so a changed dependency may require a dependent package version bump. The crates.io workflow checks exact-version availability for every workspace package, considers every publishable workspace package, skips exact versions already present on crates.io, and publishes the missing versions in dependency order with `tapid` last. A locally unpublishable path dependency is accepted only when that exact package version is already available from crates.io.

Reconsider a coordinated runtime-crate release group at `0.1.0` only if release evidence shows that nearly every runtime crate changes together. Do not retroactively normalize existing versions.

## Roles and approval boundaries

The flow has separate review and promotion gates:

1. A normal pull request reviews version, lockfile, release notes, and any changed supporting-crate versions.
2. Merging does not publish anything.
3. Creating the annotated tag is the immutable source-selection boundary.
4. The binary workflow creates a draft but never publishes it.
5. Publishing the reviewed draft is the public GitHub release boundary.
6. Public installer smoke tests must pass after publication.
7. crates.io publication is a separate manual dispatch and protected-environment approval.
8. A successful workflow is not sufficient by itself. Public endpoints, bytes, installed versions, registry versions, and final repository state require independent read-back.

Do not combine GitHub binary publication and crates.io publication into one approval.

## Standard release procedure

Use terminal-based `git` and `gh` operations. Keep credentials out of commands, logs, notes, and commits.

### 1. Prepare a reviewed release pull request

The release pull request must:

- update the `tapid` package to the intended product version;
- update only changed supporting-crate versions and affected dependency requirements;
- regenerate `Cargo.lock` through Cargo;
- add `docs/releases/<version>.md`;
- avoid hardcoding the version in reusable smoke or installer automation;
- pass the complete required check set and automated review on its final head;
- have every actionable review conversation answered and resolved.

Run the release contract tests before declaring the pull request ready:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types --test tools/check_architecture_test.ts tools/release/release_test.ts tools/release/installers_test.ts tools/release/publish_test.ts
```

Before merge, record the exact pull-request head and base. After merge, read back the concrete merge commit and verify that it is the expected protected `main` tip. Wait for post-merge CI and security checks on that exact commit.

### 2. Create the immutable annotated tag

Set the intended values explicitly:

```sh
VERSION=X.Y.Z
TAG="v$VERSION"
COMMIT="REPLACE_WITH_VERIFIED_RELEASE_MERGE_COMMIT"
```

Verify the source before creating the tag:

```sh
set -euo pipefail
git fetch --no-tags origin "+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main"
test "$(git rev-parse "origin/main^{commit}")" = "$COMMIT"
test "$(git show "$COMMIT:crates/tapid-cli/Cargo.toml" | sed -n 's/^version = "\([^"]*\)"/\1/p' | head -1)" = "$VERSION"

test -z "$(git tag --list "$TAG")" || {
  echo "local tag already exists; use the failed tag-push recovery procedure: $TAG" >&2
  exit 1
}
remote_tag_refs="$(git ls-remote origin "refs/tags/$TAG" "refs/tags/$TAG^{}")"
test -z "$remote_tag_refs" || {
  echo "remote tag already exists: $TAG" >&2
  exit 1
}
```

Create and push the annotated tag exactly once:

```sh
git tag -a "$TAG" "$COMMIT" -m "Tapid $TAG"
git push origin "refs/tags/$TAG"
```

Immediately read back both the tag object and peeled commit:

```sh
git ls-remote origin "refs/tags/$TAG" "refs/tags/$TAG^{}"
```

Record both object identifiers. Never move, recreate, delete and recreate, or force-push a release tag.

### 3. Verify the binary workflow

The tag-triggered workflow must:

- refetch and validate the remote annotated tag object;
- require the peeled commit to belong to `main`;
- check out the exact peeled commit for metadata validation and every build;
- build the six native targets on Linux, macOS, and Windows runners;
- execute each native binary and require `tapid <version>`;
- produce six platform archives;
- aggregate artifacts by explicit name pattern;
- create one new draft release only when no release already matches the tag;
- retain the numeric release ID returned by creation;
- tolerate brief collection read-after-write delay with bounded retries;
- require exactly one matching release whose ID equals the create response;
- generate `tapid-release-v1.tsv` from the immutable archive bytes;
- upload and read back the exact eight-asset set.

Warnings and notices are evidence, not harmless decoration. Inspect the workflow annotations even when every job is green. Upgrade deprecated action runtimes and validate announced runner-image migrations in an ordinary pull request before their deadlines.

### 4. Review the draft by numeric release ID

A draft is not public and some tag-based REST endpoints return 404 for drafts. List releases, including drafts, identify exactly one matching tag, and retain its numeric ID. Use that ID for subsequent API reads and asset downloads.

The expected asset set is exactly:

- `tapid-<version>-aarch64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- `tapid-<version>-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz`
- `tapid-<version>-aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
- `tapid-<version>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
- `tapid-<version>-aarch64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz`
- `tapid-<version>-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.tar.gz`
- `SHA256SUMS`
- `tapid-release-v1.tsv`

This is eight assets for the new release flow. Historical releases through 0.0.10 have seven assets and no release record. Recovery must use the asset contract of the original tagged workflow; never add metadata to a published historical release.

Before publication:

1. Require `draft=true`, `prerelease=false`, the exact tag, and the expected release ID.
2. Require exactly eight assets and no unexpected names for a new release.
3. Record every asset ID, name, and provider-reported size.
4. Download every asset from GitHub by numeric asset ID into a fresh directory.
5. Compare each downloaded size with the provider-reported size.
6. Verify all six archives against the downloaded `SHA256SUMS`.
7. Require each archive to contain exactly one regular file named `tapid` or `tapid.exe`, as appropriate.
8. Execute the locally compatible downloaded binary and require `tapid <version>`.
9. Correlate the other binaries with successful native build jobs that executed the version check.
10. Review `docs/releases/<version>.md` and require the draft body to match it exactly.
11. Parse the release record and compare all six rows with the downloaded archive names, byte counts, SHA-256 values, and immutable public download URLs. Require its version to match the tag.

On macOS, checksum verification can use:

```sh
(cd <download-directory> && shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS)
```

On Linux, use `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`.

An HTTP 200 response does not prove installation or asset correctness.

### 5. Edit draft metadata safely

The create-release API requires `tag_name`; the update-release API does not. During `v0.0.8`, however, an incomplete metadata update through the client and payload shape used at the time exposed the draft under an internal `untagged-*` slug. Treat that observed failure as a reason to make draft edits explicit and immediately verifiable, not as a claim that every PATCH requires a complete record.

Avoid editing metadata after final draft approval. If notes or other metadata must change before approval, identify the release by numeric ID, snapshot its current state, and send a minimal update containing only the fields that are intentionally changing. Avoid a client or payload shape that injects defaults for omitted fields.

Before and after the update, compare:

- `tag_name`;
- `target_commitish`;
- `name`;
- `body`;
- `draft=true`;
- `prerelease=false`;
- `make_latest=false`.

For an existing annotated tag, `target_commitish` does not determine source identity. Keep the draft's normal `main` value. The existing annotated tag and its peeled commit are the immutable source binding.

Changing `target_commitish` to an older commit that modifies `.github/workflows` relative to the default branch can require additional OAuth `workflow` scope. GitHub may deliberately return 404 when that scope is absent. Do not broaden token scope merely to make an unnecessary metadata edit work.

After every draft edit, read back the release by numeric ID and through the draft-aware `gh release view` surface. Require the original release ID, exact tag, expected asset set, reviewed body, `draft=true`, and unchanged remote tag object and peeled commit. Require every field outside the intended change set to remain byte-for-byte or value-for-value unchanged. The edit invalidates any prior approval; repeat the final draft review before publication.

### 6. Publish the reviewed draft

Publication requires explicit human approval after the final draft read-back. Promote the already-reviewed numeric release record without resupplying its notes, title, tag, target, or prerelease state:

```sh
RELEASE_ID="REPLACE_WITH_VERIFIED_NUMERIC_RELEASE_ID"
case "$RELEASE_ID" in
  ''|*[!0-9]*) echo "invalid numeric release ID" >&2; exit 1 ;;
esac
gh api --method PATCH \
  "repos/LimeTip/tapid/releases/$RELEASE_ID" \
  -F draft=false \
  -f make_latest=true
```

This minimizes the irreversible promotion mutation and prevents a dirty, stale, or later-modified local notes file from replacing the approved body at publication time.

Immediately verify through an unauthenticated API request that:

- the public release ID is the reviewed draft ID;
- `tag_name` equals the intended tag;
- `draft=false` and `prerelease=false`;
- the exact eight assets remain present for the new release;
- the release is immutable when repository release immutability is enabled;
- the remote annotated tag object and peeled commit are unchanged.

### 7. Verify public installation

Publication triggers `.github/workflows/release-public-smoke.yml` at the tagged commit. Require the resolver to succeed and all three platform jobs:



- `Unix installer (ubuntu-latest)`;
- `Unix installer (macos-latest)`;
- `Windows installer`.

Each platform must:

1. Download the tagged installer from the source provider and retain its URL, release source revision, script digest, and installation evidence.
2. Install the explicit published version, execute it, and require `tapid <version>`.
3. Independently download the public `tapid.dev` installer, install the explicit version, and require the same binary bytes as the tagged installer produced.
4. Install latest through the public website installer without an explicit version and verify its expected version.
5. For a latest release newer than 0.0.10, install the highest supported earlier stable version found among the latest 100 releases, upgrade it, and compare its resulting version and executable digest with the independent latest installation.
6. Repeat the upgrade and require the exact already-up-to-date output and unchanged executable bytes. Retain evidence even on failure.

The scheduled daily run covers Linux; release and manual runs cover Linux, macOS, and Windows. Historical latest versions through 0.0.10 explicitly skip the new truthful-repeat assertion. The canonical documentation upgrade check remains separate. Matching source and destination releases demonstrate repeated installation, not a previous-version upgrade.

Read the job steps and logs. Do not infer real installation from workflow success alone.

The supplemental root-script fixture uses `tests/fixtures/validate_consumer_project.js`
against the installed binary, not a source build. Before tagging, review its
`releaseContracts` capability table alongside `docs/examples/contracts.json`.
Unknown published tags fail until reviewed; never infer support from an arbitrary
command failure. The native Restricted contract requires macOS child execution,
exact arguments, environment/exit-code checks and receipts. Linux and Windows
must instead return the specific unsupported-containment rejection with no child
marker or receipt. The historical uncontained contract retains forwarding checks
without claiming containment. These expected contracts are not public execution
evidence.

Latest discovery and the configured Unix upgrade checks depend on their explicit
installation prerequisites, not on successful supplemental script checks. An
earlier failure still fails the job. Upgrade reports remain required for attempted
upgrades; a skipped upgrade does not trigger a misleading missing-artifact failure.
Inspect skipped prerequisites separately and do not count them as verified.

Do not start crates.io publication until the public release and all three installer jobs are verified against the exact tag commit.

### 8. Verify and dispatch crates.io publication separately

Run the live dry-run before dispatch:

```sh
node --experimental-strip-types tools/release/publish.ts --dry-run
```

Review the exact missing package/version sequence. Every package in that plan must have exactly one crates.io Trusted Publisher configuration with:

- repository owner `LimeTip`;
- repository name `tapid`;
- workflow `crates-publication.yml`;
- environment `crates-io-release`;
- trusted-publishing-only enabled.

The GitHub environment must:

- allow the workflow run from `main`;
- require independent approval;
- prevent the dispatching actor from approving the same deployment.

Dispatch only after a separate explicit approval:

```sh
gh workflow run crates-publication.yml \
  --repo LimeTip/tapid \
  --ref main \
  -f tag="$TAG"
```

The workflow checks out the tag, validates that it is annotated and belongs to `main`, verifies the matching public GitHub release and exact-tag public smoke run, packages the workspace, acquires a short-lived OIDC token, and publishes only missing packages in dependency order.

No long-lived crates.io token is stored in GitHub. Do not add one as a fallback.

After environment approval, verify every package through the crates.io API before treating it as published. Then perform a clean registry installation of the exact `tapid` version and execute the installed binary.

### 9. Complete final public read-back

A release is complete only after verifying:

- protected `main` and its post-merge checks;
- annotated tag object and peeled commit;
- public immutable GitHub release and reviewed release ID;
- exact asset names, sizes, and SHA-256 values from public downloads;
- archive structure and locally compatible binary version;
- public `tapid.dev/install.sh` and `tapid.dev/install.ps1` endpoints;
- latest and explicit-version `tapid.dev/releases/v1/*.tsv` records matching the published archive metadata;
- explicit-version installation on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows;
- latest-release discovery installation on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows;
- previous-version upgrade and unchanged repeat upgrade on those platforms;
- every planned crates.io version;
- clean `cargo install tapid --version <version> --locked` behavior;
- final repository, release, tag, workflow, and registry state.

## Recovery procedures

Recovery must preserve the original annotated tag and exact tagged commit.

### Local annotated tag exists after a failed push

If local tag creation succeeded but `git push` failed or returned an uncertain result, do not delete or recreate the local tag and do not rerun the tag-creation block.

Set `TAG` and `COMMIT` to the intended release values, then validate and safely resume:

```sh
set -euo pipefail
tag_ref="refs/tags/$TAG"

test "$(git cat-file -t "$tag_ref")" = tag
local_tag_object="$(git rev-parse "$tag_ref")"
local_tag_commit="$(git rev-parse "$tag_ref^{commit}")"
test "$local_tag_commit" = "$COMMIT"

git fetch --no-tags origin "+refs/heads/main:refs/remotes/origin/main"
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$COMMIT" origin/main

remote_refs="$(git ls-remote origin "$tag_ref" "$tag_ref^{}")"
if test -z "$remote_refs"; then
  git push origin "$tag_ref:$tag_ref"
else
  remote_tag_object=
  remote_tag_commit=
  while IFS=$'\t' read -r object_id ref_name; do
    case "$ref_name" in
      "$tag_ref") remote_tag_object="$object_id" ;;
      "$tag_ref^{}") remote_tag_commit="$object_id" ;;
    esac
  done <<< "$remote_refs"

  test "$remote_tag_object" = "$local_tag_object"
  test "$remote_tag_commit" = "$local_tag_commit"
fi

verified_refs="$(git ls-remote origin "$tag_ref" "$tag_ref^{}")"
verified_tag_object=
verified_tag_commit=
while IFS=$'\t' read -r object_id ref_name; do
  case "$ref_name" in
    "$tag_ref") verified_tag_object="$object_id" ;;
    "$tag_ref^{}") verified_tag_commit="$object_id" ;;
  esac
done <<< "$verified_refs"
test "$verified_tag_object" = "$local_tag_object"
test "$verified_tag_commit" = "$local_tag_commit"
```

An exact remote match means the original push succeeded despite the uncertain local result. An absent remote ref permits retrying the same local tag push. A lightweight remote tag, different tag object, or different peeled commit is a hard stop requiring investigation; never replace it.

### Tag-triggered workflow fails before draft creation

1. Diagnose the failed run and preserve its logs.
2. Fix the workflow through a normal reviewed pull request.
3. Merge and verify post-merge checks.
4. Manually dispatch the current input-free release workflow from `main`.
5. The workflow derives the expected tag from reviewed Cargo metadata, refetches the remote annotated tag, and builds the exact peeled commit.

Never recreate or push the tag again merely to retrigger the workflow. Do not rerun a historical workflow revision if it would build mutable `main` instead of the exact tag commit.

### Draft exists but workflow failed before or during asset upload

Do not dispatch the create-only workflow again and do not create a duplicate release.

1. Identify the existing draft by listing all releases and recording its numeric ID.
2. Confirm the draft tag and ID correspond to the failed create response.
3. Download only successful build artifacts from the exact failed run.
4. Require all six expected archives and reject extra files.
5. Generate and verify `SHA256SUMS` from those exact bytes. For the new release flow, also generate the release record using that version's immutable public download directory.
6. Inspect archive layout and correlate native version checks with the build logs.
7. List assets already attached to the draft by numeric release ID. Require their names to be a unique subset of the expected asset set and reject unexpected or duplicate names. Use eight assets for the new flow or seven for a historical tagged workflow.
8. Download every existing asset by numeric asset ID. Require its size and SHA-256 to match the corresponding locally recovered file exactly. Stop on any mismatch; never overwrite or delete an ambiguous asset.
9. Upload only expected names that are not already present, using the existing numeric release ID.
10. Download every resulting asset back by numeric asset ID.
11. Recheck names, sizes, checksums, archive layout, draft state, tag object, and peeled commit.

Manual recovery is an evidence-preserving exception, not the normal release path.

### Draft tag becomes `untagged-*`

Stop before publication. Do not delete the release or tag.

1. Locate the draft through the release collection and confirm its original numeric ID and expected asset set.
2. Confirm the real annotated version tag still exists and peels to the original commit.
3. Restore the draft with a complete metadata update containing the intended `tag_name`, `target_commitish: main`, title, reviewed body, `draft=true`, `prerelease=false`, and `make_latest=false`.
4. Read back by numeric ID and with `gh release view <tag>`.
5. Require the same ID, exact tag, expected asset set, reviewed notes, draft state, and unchanged tag object before continuing.

A 404 while changing the target to an older workflow-bearing commit can mean the token lacks OAuth `workflow` scope. Keep `target_commitish: main` for an existing tag instead of expanding credentials. The annotated tag remains the source binding.

### Public smoke fails after publication

A published immutable release cannot be repaired in place.

1. Stop crates.io publication.
2. Preserve logs and determine affected platforms.
3. Communicate the limitation if users can encounter it.
4. Fix through a new reviewed patch release with a new annotated tag.
5. Do not move the existing tag, replace assets, or pretend a rerun changed published bytes.

### crates.io publication partially succeeds

Published crate versions are immutable.

1. Record every confirmed package/version and the failing package.
2. Query crates.io independently rather than trusting only the failed workflow log.
3. Run `tools/release/publish.ts --dry-run` again against the registry.
4. Require the new plan to contain only the still-missing suffix of the dependency order.
5. Respect crates.io rate-limit instructions and avoid rapid blind retries.
6. Redispatch only after confirming the failure is safely resumable and obtaining the required environment approval.

## Evidence ledger

Record the following for every release in the release issue, pull request, or operator record:

- release-preparation PR URL, final head, and merge commit;
- post-merge check-run IDs and conclusions;
- annotated tag object ID and peeled commit;
- binary workflow run ID and any recovery run ID;
- draft/public release ID;
- asset IDs, names, sizes, and SHA-256 values;
- release-notes source and exact read-back result;
- publication time and immutable state;
- public smoke run ID, tagged commit, three job names, and conclusions;
- crates.io dry-run plan;
- Trusted Publisher verification result;
- crates.io workflow run ID and independent approval state;
- published package/version set;
- clean registry installation command and binary output;
- final public endpoint and repository-state verification.

Replace credentials, tokens, cookies, signing material, and secret values with `[REDACTED]`. Do not store them in the evidence ledger.

## Prohibited actions

Never:

- move, recreate, delete and recreate, or force-push a release tag;
- publish a draft before exact asset and note verification;
- use an HTTP 200 response as installation evidence;
- select a draft upload target only by tag when a numeric release ID is available;
- overwrite release assets or create a duplicate release during recovery;
- rebuild mutable `main` and label it as an existing tagged release;
- publish crates.io packages before public installer smoke succeeds;
- fall back to a long-lived crates.io token when Trusted Publishing fails;
- align unchanged crate versions merely for cosmetic consistency;
- call a release complete before independent public and registry read-back.

## Residual risks

- Domain, route configuration, release provider, repository, or workflow compromise can substitute both an archive and its release record. SHA-256 is not independent release authorization.
- The installers do not enforce rollback protection beyond selecting a requested immutable release version.
- Public smoke tests run after publication and can detect but cannot prevent a broken release from briefly being available.
- macOS and Windows platform code signing are not part of this flow.
